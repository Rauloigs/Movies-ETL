# Summary
Amazing Prime wants to keep the database updated, so we need your to create an automated pipeline that takes in all the new data.
We are repeating the process to perform the transformations and loads into the existing tables. 

## Personal Notes
It was a pretty challenging Challenge. Was able to run the code properly but not reaching the expected results. With this I mean, some columns were not dropped, and some rows were not pulled out while cleaning the code. I re checked several times but wasnÂ´t really capable to excecuted the work properly. 

Nevertheless I am happy to be able to little by little comprehend the steps for ETL.
